# complied-SE-indexes

todo:

order by index by alphabetical order

how to edit file so char's in file are not overidden, create spaces in the file for index to be inserted/move the rest of the file downwards, testing started in SelfWriting.cpp and SelfWritingcopy.cpp, have got the program to write at file pointer but will overide the code below it.

How to store index
- one binary variable? (e.g., index = {doc, tf), (doc, tf), ...)
- variable by first letter (e.g., index-a = (docnum, tf), index-b (docnum, tf))
- variable by word (e.g., apple = (docnum, tf), banana = (docnum, tf))

- is there a limit on the size of a variable?

Compression
- will need to compress the index, probably variable byte

Write the search
- waiting to do this because search will be different depending on how the index is stored
